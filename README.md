# Probability-Theory-Statistics-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
These are my python notebooks for the course - Probability Theory, Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis from HSE University, Russia.

Exploration of Data Science requires certain background in probability and statistics. This online course introduces you to the necessary
sections of probability theory and statistics, guiding you from the very basics all way up to the level required for jump starting your 
ascent in Data Science.

The core concept of the course is random variable â€” i.e. variable whose values are determined by random experiment. Random variables are 
used as a model for data generation processes we want to study.Properties of the data are deeply linked to the corresponding properties of 
random variables, such as expected value, variance and correlations. Dependencies between random variables are crucial factor that allows 
us to predict unknown quantities based on known values, which forms the basis of supervised machine learning. We begin with the notion of 
independent events and conditional probability, then introduce two main classes of random variables: discrete and continuous and study their 
properties. Finally, we learn different types of data and their connection with random variables.
